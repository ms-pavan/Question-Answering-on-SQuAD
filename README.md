# Question Answering on SQuAD

### Project Description 

A Question answering system should be able to read a paragraph and answer questions related to it. The dataset I choose to work on for this project is Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD 2.0) (1). SQuAD is a dataset comprising of more than more than 100,000 question-answer pairs from 500 Wikipedia articles posed by crowdworkers. The answer to a question is a span of text from the related paragraph or the question might not be answerable. To perform well on SQuAD 2.0, the system should not only answer when itâ€™s possible but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.
